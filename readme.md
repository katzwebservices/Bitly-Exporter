### Export your Bitly data

**Bitly is one of the most popular link shortening services, and rightly so:** it is stable, easy to use, and has pretty looking statistics. <strong>One thing Bitly does not do is export data.</strong> There is simple no other Bitly exporter out there.  

The Bitly Exporter plugin allows you to export up to three years of daily click data for your links. This allows you to analyse click data like you always wanted to!

### In the administration, you get:

* A nice graph of clicks
* A table of click data for the requested period

### The exported CSV includes:

* # of Clicks
* Timestamp
* Date (formatted)
* Day of Week
* Week #
* Month #
* Year
* Days Since Export
